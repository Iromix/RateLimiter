# Rate Limiter

There is a limit of `N` tokens available for use per second. Write a component that will answer the question - `can I pass?`. If yes - the token is consumed.

The tokens are used as permits by clients of the system. If token is available the client will do some work, otherwise itâ€™ll need to give up during current second. 

Clients run in separate threads.
